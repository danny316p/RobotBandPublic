===============

Repository of publicly available information and files related to the NXT Robot Band.

This is something of a placeholder at the moment - most of the code used for the NXT Robot Band is actually fairly poorly written, but as things worth sharing come out of it, I will share them here. Maybe I'll create some LDraw files of the LEGO builds involved as well. If a particularly useful tool comes out of this, I'll probably split that off into another repository. License to be determined.

...also, Github provides bugtracking. Please try not to inundate me with song requests, but you are welcome to make suggestions, and file bug reports or enhancement requests that may improve the band in the future.

Looking for "public"-facing information about the band and future shows? That's still at https://twitter.com/NXTRobotBand
